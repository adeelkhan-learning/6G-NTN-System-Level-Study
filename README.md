# 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN): A System-Level Architectural Study
An independent, operator-centric study on integrating NTN as a native access in 5G-Advanced and future 6G networks.
The evolution toward 6G networks is expected to extend mobile connectivity beyond traditional terrestrial boundaries, enabling seamless service availability in remote, rural, and infrastructure-challenged environments. Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), leveraging satellite-based access, are emerging as a key enabler of this vision.
This study presents a system-level analysis of a hybrid terrestrial–NTN cellular architecture aligned with 5G Standalone (SA) and future 6G design principles. The objective is to evaluate how Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite systems can complement terrestrial cellular networks from an operator perspective.
The analysis focuses on operator-relevant performance indicators, including latency, round-trip time (RTT), throughput, voice service feasibility, mobility continuity, and service availability. Rather than detailed physical-layer modeling, the study emphasizes end-to-end system behavior, architectural trade-offs, and deployment considerations relevant to real-world cellular networks.
Key findings indicate that LEO satellites offer the most balanced performance for broadband and latency-sensitive services, while MEO and GEO satellites provide wider coverage and stability at the cost of increased latency. NTN is best positioned as a complementary access technology, supporting coverage extension, service continuity, and resilience, particularly in areas where deploying terrestrial infrastructure or VSAT-backed base stations is economically or operationally challenging.
The study also discusses regulatory, spectrum, cost, and scalability considerations, highlighting that while NTN adoption is progressing globally, deployment strategies must remain policy-driven, use-case-specific, and aligned with operator business models. Ongoing advancements in satellite technology are expected to further enhance NTN performance, reinforcing its role in future 6G ecosystems.
This work aims to provide practical insights for mobile network operators, researchers, and technology planners exploring NTN-enabled cellular architectures as part of the 6G evolution.
Summarizing:
•	LEO-based NTN offers the best balance between latency and coverage extension
•	NTN is most effective as a controlled fallback and resilience layer
•	Hybrid terrestrial–NTN architectures align well with operator cost models
This study is an independent, system-level technical analysis developed from a mobile network operator perspective. It is intended to bridge practical cellular network experience with emerging research directions in 6G and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). The work emphasizes architectural clarity, operational feasibility, and deployment realism rather than protocol-level or physical-layer optimization.

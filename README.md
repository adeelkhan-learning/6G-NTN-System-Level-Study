# 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN): A System-Level Architectural Study

## 📡 An operator-centric technical study on hybrid terrestrial–NTN integration for 6G-ready cellular networks

This repository contains an independent system-level study analyzing how Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can be practically integrated with existing terrestrial cellular networks, with a forward-looking alignment to 6G design principles.

The focus is on architecture, performance trade-offs, mobility, spectrum coexistence, and deployment feasibility from a mobile network operator (MNO) perspective.

# 📘 Overview

As cellular networks evolve toward 6G, coverage continuity, resilience, and global reach become fundamental design goals. NTN—enabled by LEO, MEO, and GEO satellites—offers a powerful complement to terrestrial networks, particularly in remote, rural, maritime, desert, disaster-prone, and cross-border regions.

This study:

	•	Treats NTN as a native access extension, not a bolt-on solution
	
	•	Emphasizes system-level KPIs, not physical-layer simulations
	
	•	Bridges the gap between academic NTN research and operator deployment reality

	•	NTN access is subject to UE capability and operator enablement, in line with 3GPP NTN specifications

# 🎯 Objectives of the Study

This work aims to:

	1.	Model and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to integrated terrestrial–NTN networks
	
	2.	Quantify performance differences between terrestrial access and NTN access using LEO, MEO, and GEO satellite systems
	
	3.	Identify system-level limitations affecting service quality and continuity
	
	4.	Propose optimization strategies aligned with 6G principles and operator constraints
	
	5.	Provide practical insights to guide future research, standardization, and deployment decisions

# 🔍 Scope & Assumptions

To maintain practical relevance, the study adopts the following scope:

	•	Focus on system-level behavior, not detailed PHY or protocol implementation
	
	•	Downlink-centric analysis, with uplink discussed conceptually
	
	•	Simplified but realistic propagation and mobility models
	
	•	Emphasis on operator-relevant KPIs (latency, RTT, Doppler, coverage continuity)
	
	•	NTN primarily considered for areas without existing terrestrial coverage

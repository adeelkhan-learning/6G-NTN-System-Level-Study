# 6G-NTN-System-Level-Study
This study presents a system-level analysis of a hybrid terrestrial–NTN cellular architecture aligned with 5G Standalone (SA) and future 6G design principles. The objective is to evaluate how LEO, MEO, and GEO satellite systems can complement terrestrial cellular networks from an operator perspective.
